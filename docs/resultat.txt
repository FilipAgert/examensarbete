Tol = 1/N, NEV = 1, N = 201x201
 Number of restarts (energies): 30
 Tol means calculated eigenvalue is within tolerance of actual eigenvalue (lambda- lambda_c) < tol where lambda_c calculated eigenvalue and lambda real eigenvalue

1st solve: 2.06s          (equal prob in all states)
2nd solve: .87s           (re-use 1st solution)     (using previous solution does help)
3rd solve: .77s           (lin-comb of 1st and second sultion) (linear interpolation does not help)

Iterative: TIME = 98.06 (approx 4 times slower)
Matrix multiplications: 58800 (5.9e4)

1st solve: 28.19s  (equal probability in all states)
2nd solve: 5.39s   (re-use 1st solution)
3rd solve  3.03s   (lin-comb of 1st and 2nd solution)

For iterative solver: TOL = 1/(N*1e2), where tol>|phi_n - phi_n+1|_{L2} leads to iteration stop .
